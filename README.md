## Description ðŸ“™
 
A recipe website to showcase my project on simple HTML & CSS
 
 You can check the [Project here](https://terraelfi.github.io/odin-recipes/).
 
 ## Thoughts ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
This project is fairly straightforward. I didn't include any fancy Javascript code.
Although it's not particularly simple or difficult for me, I primarily use Google to find anything I want to do.
 
 
 ## Reference ðŸ“™
 I use allrecipes.com for reference and all of the images that I use are from google images.
 Also from the help of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) website that teaches me fullstack development.
